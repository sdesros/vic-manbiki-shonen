!- File to generate special characters before basic.
!- Hit any key to resume after the special charactesr are displayed.
!- trick to load everything in one file:

!- BASIC stub
!- 1 POKE44,28:RUN
!-
!- Second, you'd put the BASIC start at 7169:
!- POKE44,28:POKE7168,0:NEW
!-
!- Finally, you'd place a complete copy of the uppercase character set at 5120:
!- FORT=0TO2047:POKE5120+T,PEEK(32768+T):NEXT
!-
!- Now, you can start to write your own program. The charset at 5120 is activated with POKE 36869,205. The text screen is located at 4096, and colour RAM at 37888. If you want to save everything, write:
!- POKE44,18:SAVE"NAME",8
!-
!- Then upon LIST, or reload, you'll see the line
!- 1 POKE44,28:RUN
!-
!- again, which starts your own program as you type RUN - and then you can edit it again.
!-
!- One small caveat: if you load such a program when the BASIC start is already put at 7169, line 1 enters an infinite loop, as the BASIC start isn't altered, and line 1 just re-runs itself.
